# Implementation-of-a-jounal-file-in-the-FAT-file-system-driver-of-the-Linux-kernel

The **Linux Kernel Library (LKL**), is the source code of the Linux kernel in the form of a library. By linking the library with an application, we can run the Linux kernel in user space. Here, we extend the FAT file system driver in the **Linux Kernel Library** to provide a **journaling** file that records all modifications happening in the file system, during application execution.

Based on the tutor's detailed project description (see **ProjectDescription.pdf** file),
the implementation, on the **Linux Kernel Library**, of the FAT filesytem driver, is provided via the **Report.pdf file**, which explains step by step the changes in souce code. Also the files whose source code in the LKL repository are modified, inside the fat folder (https://github.com/lsds/lkl/tree/upstream-refactor/fs/fat),
are provided, in the **lkl-source** folder.
