# Implementation-of-a-jounal-file-in-the-FAT-file-system-driver-of-the-Linux-kernel

The Linux Kernel Library (LKL), is the source code of the Linux kernel in the form of a library. By linking the library with an application, we can run the Linux kernel in user space. Here, we extend the FAT file system driver in the Linux kernel library to provide a journaling file that records all modifications happening in the file system, during application execution.
